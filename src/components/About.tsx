              I'm a passionate Frontend Developer and Designer with a strong foundation in Computer Science. 
              My journey spans across web development, cybersecurity, AI/ML, and data visualization, with hands-on experience 
              in building user-centric applications that blend functionality with beautiful design.

              From developing full-stack web applications to securing drone systems and building machine learning models, 
              I thrive on creating solutions that make a real-world impact. I believe great design isn't just about aestheticsâ€”it's 
              about creating intuitive experiences that users love.
